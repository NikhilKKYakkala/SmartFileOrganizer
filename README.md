# SmartFileOrganizer

SmartFileOrganizer is a flexible Python-based tool that helps you automatically organize files in any folder based on **file type**, **date**, or **both** — keeping your directories clean, efficient, and easy to navigate.

## 🚀 Features
- Organize files by:
  - File Type (e.g., PDFs, Images, Executables)
  - Date (e.g., organized into Year-Month folders)
  - Combination of File Type and Date
- Customizable target folder (choose any folder you want)
- Automatically creates necessary subfolders if they don't exist
- Detailed logging of all operations
- Easy to schedule (with Task Scheduler, cron jobs, etc.)

## 📂 Example Folder Structures
**By Type:**
```
Downloads/
├── PDFs/
├── Images/
├── Videos/
```

**By Date:**
```
Downloads/
├── 2025-04/
├── 2025-05/
```

**By Both:**
```
Downloads/
├── PDFs/
│   ├── 2025-04/
│   ├── 2025-05/
├── Images/
│   ├── 2025-04/
│   ├── 2025-05/
```
